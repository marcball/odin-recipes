  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 ½ ounces pork rinds, crushed</li>
    <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    <li>½ cup jarred tomato sauce (such as Rao's®)</li>
    <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    </li>
    <li>Slice chicken breast through the middle horizontally from one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Pound chicken flat until about 1/2-inch thick.    </li>
    <li>Beat egg and cream together in a bowl.    </li>
    <li>Combine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, red pepper, black pepper, and Italian seasoning in a separate shallow bowl or plate.    </li>
    <li>Dip chicken into egg mixture; coat completely. Press chicken into breading; thickly coat both sides.    </li>
    <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add ghee. Place chicken in the pan; cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Be careful to keep breading in place.    </li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Cover with tomato sauce; top with mozzarella cheese.   </li>
    <li>Broil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
